## Technical Implementation

### Event Status Logic
Uses the existing `getEventStatus()` function from `src/lib/utils.ts`:
- `'upcoming'` - Event hasn't started yet
- `'ongoing'` - Event is currently happening (within 4 hours of start time)
- `'completed'` - Event has ended

### Date Grouping
- **Events Page**: Groups by date, sorts earliest first
- **PreviousEvents Page**: Groups by date, sorts most recent first
- **Smart Headers**: Shows "Today", "Tomorrow", "Yesterday" for better UX

### Modal Dialogs
- **Large Modal**: 6xl width for Events page (grid layout)
- **Medium Modal**: 4xl width for PreviousEvents page (list layout)
- **Scrollable**: Both modals support scrolling for large event lists
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Filtering
Both pages support:
- City filtering
- Event type filtering
- Clear filters functionality
