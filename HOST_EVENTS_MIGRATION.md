# Host Events Migration Guide

## Overview

This migration updates the event management system to use a direct `host` field in the `events` table instead of relying on the `host_events` junction table. This change ensures that events created by hosts are immediately visible in the frontend and simplifies the data structure.

## What Changed

### Before (Old Structure)
- Events were stored in the `events` table
- Host-event relationships were managed through the `host_events` junction table
- Hosts had to be explicitly assigned to events via the junction table
- Events created by hosts weren't immediately visible in the frontend

### After (New Structure)
- Events are stored in the `events` table with a direct `host` field
- The `host` field directly references the host ID
- Events created by hosts are immediately visible in the frontend
- The `host_events` table is still maintained for admin-assigned events and permissions

## Key Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility**: Events created by hosts appear instantly in the frontend
2. **Simplified Queries**: No need for complex joins to get host events
3. **Better Performance**: Direct field access is faster than junction table queries
4. **Consistent Data**: Single source of truth for host-event relationships

## Database Changes

### Events Table
- The `host` field now directly stores the host ID
- Added index on the `host` field for better performance
- Updated RLS policies to allow hosts to manage their events

### Views Updated
- `host_dashboard_view`: Now uses direct host field
- `attendance_summary_view`: Now uses direct host field

### New Functions
- `assign_host_to_event()`: For admin-assigned events
- `remove_host_from_event()`: For removing host assignments

## Code Changes

### Host Service (`src/services/hostService.ts`)
- `getHostEvents()`: Now fetches events directly from `events` table using `host` field
- `getHostDashboardData()`: Updated to work with new structure
- `getAttendanceSummary()`: Updated to work with new structure

### Host Dashboard (`src/pages/HostDashboard.tsx`)
- Updated to work with `Event` objects directly instead of `HostEvent` objects
- Added real-time subscription for events table changes
- Simplified event selection and display logic

### Admin Dashboard (`src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
- Already compatible with new structure
- Host activity tracking works with direct host field

## Migration Steps

### 1. Run the Migration Script
Execute the `migrate_host_events.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This will:
-- 1. Update existing events to populate the host field
-- 2. Create helper functions for host assignment
-- 3. Update database views
-- 4. Add performance indexes
-- 5. Update RLS policies
```

### 2. Deploy Code Changes
The following files have been updated:
- `src/services/hostService.ts`
- `src/pages/HostDashboard.tsx`

### 3. Test the Changes
1. Create a new event as a host
2. Verify it appears immediately in the host dashboard
3. Verify it appears in the frontend events list
4. Test attendance marking functionality
5. Verify admin dashboard host activity tracking

## Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains backward compatibility:
- The `host_events` table is still maintained for admin-assigned events
- Existing functionality continues to work
- No data loss occurs during migration

## Rollback Plan

If needed, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting the code changes
2. Running a rollback SQL script to restore the old structure
3. The `host_events` table remains intact for this purpose

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- Faster queries for host events (direct field access)
- Reduced complexity in data fetching
- Better caching with React Query

### Monitoring
- Monitor query performance for host dashboard
- Check real-time subscription performance
- Verify attendance tracking performance

## Security Considerations

- RLS policies updated to ensure hosts can only access their own events
- Host field validation ensures proper access control
- Admin functions remain secure with proper permissions

## Future Enhancements

With this new structure, you can easily:
1. Add host-specific event features
2. Implement host performance analytics
3. Create host-specific event templates
4. Add host event approval workflows

## Support

If you encounter any issues during migration:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify database permissions
3. Test with a small dataset first
4. Review the migration logs in Supabase

## Conclusion

This migration significantly improves the user experience for hosts by making their created events immediately visible in the frontend. The simplified data structure also improves performance and maintainability of the codebase.
