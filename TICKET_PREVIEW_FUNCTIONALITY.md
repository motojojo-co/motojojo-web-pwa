- Tickets show all relevant event information
- QR codes are displayed on each ticket for easy scanning

### 3. Multiple Access Methods

- **Email Delivery**: Tickets are automatically sent via email

### 4. Ticket Actions
- **Download**: Users can download their tickets (implementation ready for html2canvas)
- **Share**: Users can share tickets via native sharing or copy link
- **Print**: Tickets are optimized for printing
- **QR Code**: Each ticket includes a scannable QR code

## Implementation Details

- Tickets are linked to bookings and events

### Booking Flow Integration

- Access control through user authentication
- Rate limiting for ticket generation

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. Book an event and verify ticket generation
2. Access tickets from profile page
3. Test QR code scanning functionality
4. Verify email delivery of tickets
5. Test sharing and download features
6. Check responsive design on different devices

### Manual Testing
